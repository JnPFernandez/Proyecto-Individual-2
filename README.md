  Strategic Analysis - Claro

# ‚úèÔ∏è Project Description
This repository contains the Dashboard developed in Power BI Desktop for the strategic analysis of telecommunications in Argentina, with a focus on internet access.  
The report visualizes historical trends, technology share, growth objectives, and geographical coverage, using the latest open data from ENACOM for Q2 2024.

# üîé Main Objectives:

- Analyze the evolution of internet access by technology (ADSL, Cablemodem, Fiber Optic) over time.

- Measure the mandatory KPI: minimum growth of 2% in accesses per 100 households per province in the next quarter.

- Propose and visualize three additional KPIs: Fiber Optic share in AMBA, Fiber Optic market share by province, and Cablemodem market share by province.

- Identify deployment and improvement opportunities in less saturated provinces.

# üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Proyecto-Individual-2/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Internet.xlsx         # Original dataset with multiple sheets

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Proyecto Integrador 2.pbix   # Power BI file (model + visualizations)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EDA.ipynb             # Jupyter Notebook containing the Exploratory Data Analysis

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Documentation (this file)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools

- **Power BI Desktop** (version 2.139.2054.0 or higher)

- **Excel** (for data preparation and review)

- **DAX** (calculated measures for KPIs)

- **Jupyter Notebook** (for exploratory analysis)

- **Python 3.19** (libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn)

# üîÅ Excel Transformations

- Removed duplicate data from the Dial-BAf sheet and all empty cells, which otherwise made the Power BI workflow heavier than the application could handle.  
- Deleted the last two rows from the "Accesos por Tecnolog√≠a" sheet, since they contained a message ("Provincial data does not match the national level, as additional information without geographic breakdown was incorporated.") that was irrelevant for both the analysis and the dashboard.

# üì• Installation and Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JnPFernandez/Proyecto-Individual-2.git
cd Proyecto-Individual-2
````

- Open the project in Power BI Desktop  

  Open `pbix/Proyecto Integrador 2.pbix`.

- Update data sources  

  In the "Transform Data" panel, check the path to `data/Internet.xlsx`.  
  Apply transformations and refresh the model.

- Explore the report  

  Navigate through the four tabs: Presentation, Access by Technology, Access per 100 Households, and Broadband ‚Äì Dial Up.

# üìä Pages Description

- **Presentation**: Cover page with project visual description and navigation buttons.  

- **Access by Technology**: Timeline of ADSL, Cablemodem, and Fiber Optic; provincial share of Cablemodem and Fiber Optic; and KPI showing the percentage of Fiber Optic accesses belonging to AMBA based on the latest data.  

- **Access per 100 Households**: Evolution compared with the 2% growth target.  

- **Broadband ‚Äì Dial Up**: Choropleth map of access growth in each province and a tree map showing the overall distribution of accesses for the last quarter.  

- **Conclusion**: A brief summary highlighting the main findings, providing insights on where current and future company efforts should be directed.  

# üéØ Key KPIs

- Growth of 2% in accesses per 100 households for the next quarter  

- Percentage of Fiber Optic accesses belonging to AMBA based on the latest data  

- Cablemodem market share by province
